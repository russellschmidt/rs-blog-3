My final project for my USC Iovine and Young 'Opportunity and Uncertainty' class this semester is [FarmHaus](https://farmhaus.app). The concept is that this is a platform for people to engage more with farmers markets.

##### Plumbing
I built this app using the create-react-app boilerplate code. The backend is [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which is a great project No SQL backend. The rumor is that it can be [very expensive to scale](https://startupsventurecapital.com/firebase-costs-increased-by-7-000-81dc0a27271d), [expensive for ongoing storage](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15394115) and maybe a [little unresponsive on the support front](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14356409) but I think it can't be beat for a proof of concept project. There are also a number of [things you can do](https://medium.com/icelytics/firebase-database-mysterious-billing-6d06f3fe4d2e) to reduce the change of getting dinged with big charges from Google for Firebase downloads.

For the mapping feature, I am using [react-map-gl](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/#/Documentation/getting-started/get-started) which is using MapBox, a fun vector-based mapping API.
