### Description
<http://thegooddoctorapp.com/>

This app ended up changing names to [Healthyness](http://healthyness.co) mid-development due to the hit ABC show 'The Good Doctor' hoovering up all the search engine attention. However, I kept the landing page up because it has a pleasant design, was a simple, fun standalone React project I put into production in a couple of hours showcasing the power of the framework, and because I just think the illustration and font make for a really friendly site.
