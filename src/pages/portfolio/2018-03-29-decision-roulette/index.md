### Description
<https://decisionroulette.netlify.com/>

Have you ever had a hard time making a decision? This app allows you to input a list of options and then click a button to randomly pick one. Obviously this is a goofy entertainment app based off an example in a [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview) from Andrew Mead, one of my favorite Udemy instructors. It is a great introduction to React, though I had to figure out how to get it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) by skipping ahead a bit and some trial and error since the tutorial is for Heroku.
