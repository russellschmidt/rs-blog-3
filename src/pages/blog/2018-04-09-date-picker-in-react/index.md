Time is a real mess. I never liked how Ruby and JS deal with time, though Rails always get a gold star from me for smooth out a lot of common issues with time and dates. The Ruby on Rails [Time API](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Time.html) made it pretty easy to calculate and format dates with methods that were sort of the best of Ruby - readable in plain English and easy to remember.

Just wanted to note the wonderful datepickers from our friends at Airbnb. If you include the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library, the legacy but still required [react-addons-shallow-compare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-addons-shallow-compare), and [Airbnb's react-dates](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates), you got yourself one fine looking React Datepicker. This is the first component I have been able to deploy to a project that I really loved so I wanted to share it here. 

The [react-dates documentation](http://airbnb.io/react-dates/) is stellar.

### Slim Date Pickins

I am making an expense tracking app based on the [excellent tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/) from [Andrew Mead](https://twitter.com/andrew_j_mead). He has a [great website, too](https://mead.io/). This guy really has a knack for explaining concepts well and unlike most tutorials, he doesn't gloss over hard parts with hand-wavy "uh yeah this is weird but just type it" moments. I need to understand everything and his courses scratch that itch.
