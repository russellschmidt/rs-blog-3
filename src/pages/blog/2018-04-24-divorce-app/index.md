An ex and I have remained friendly and split dog custody. It occurred to me that it would be great if there was an application that could support friendly custody arrangements, scheduling, and cost-sharing. 

I googled a bit and came up with this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmajohnson/2015/07/26/5-apps-to-make-divorce-easier/#4b094b23119f) of five links.

Here is the run down of each.

1. [Support Pay](https://www.forbes.com/SupportPay.com) 404'd! RIP
2. [SquareHub](http://squarehub.com/) is a private social network for families, so can provide the private communication and calendar coordination functions that I think are key to this application.
3. [OurFamilyWizard](https://www.ourfamilywizard.com/) This is a tool for parental communication between divorced parents. This includes schedule sharing, expenses, parenting time tracking, and create auditable communication channels. This seems like what I had in mind!
4. [WeVorce](https://www.forbes.com/wevorce.com) 404'd! Tip my 40 out.
5. [2houses](https://www.2houses.com/en/) is a European app with tools for calendar sharing, expense tracking and sharing, information sharing, to do list and photo sharing. It is a pay service.
