### Description
<https://rs-one-month-stripe-payments.herokuapp.com>

The important thing here is that this is a very fake store selling classes I don't actually offer. It was an introduction to Stripe and payment processing, another One Month Rails tutorial I did when I was teaching myself how to make things. You can use a test card 4242-4242-4242-4242 with any not-yet-expired date and 3 digit CCV to test that it works. 

### Stack
Ruby on Rails,
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
jQuery,
PostgreSQL,
Stripe API,
Devise,
Bootstrap,
Figaro,
Email integration

### Features
Authenticated login,
Stripe payment processing,
Heroku hosting,
Bootstrap styling,
SMTP email (Mailer) integration

### Style
Modern, bubbly look with a questionable background and typefaces. Early work is often the hardest to look at. It uses Bootstrap (2?) for the grid and some visual elements.
