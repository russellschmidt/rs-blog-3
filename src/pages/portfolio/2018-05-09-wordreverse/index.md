### Description
<https://word-reverse.netlify.com>

Inspired by a section of Marshall McLuhan's classic 'The Medium is the Massage' which we read in Storytelling class in my USC Master's program, I created a word de-scrambling game. I think I will dive into the thought behind this and the challenging quote a bit more on a blog post, but needless to say, this is a challenging game intended in part as a place to practice React, JS and SPAs and some very intentionally droll design choices.
