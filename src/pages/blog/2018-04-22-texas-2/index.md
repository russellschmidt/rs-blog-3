The Austin Final Report.

Austin, Texas has a lot going for it. The food was great, the place looks like it was built 15 minutes ago, there is a lot of construction, and the weather for our time here was pretty fantastic. The locals proved friendly and the architecture of the LBJ Presidential Library was pretty cool. 

I am revising the personal goals a bit:

1. 15 week yoga challenge - 45 classes in 15 weeks
2. Daily run working up to 60min/day
3. Start a low-carb [Keto diet](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto>)
4. Carbohydrate tracking app for keto diet
