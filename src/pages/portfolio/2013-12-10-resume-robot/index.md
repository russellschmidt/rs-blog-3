### Description
<https://russell-resume-robot.herokuapp.com>

Writing resumes sucks! This program fixes that or at least was a 2015 proof of concept about fixing that. The idea here is that we take your resume info and format them for you automatically so you do not have to sweat the million small formatting issues that resumes have. This also outputs the resume as a PDF and authenticates you with persistent storage which is great fun for coming back later and editing or adding new resumes.
