Well, I did it. I got into the USC Iovine and Young Academy, to get my Master's in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology. The shorthand is Design@USC, which is a lot easier to type but no easier to explain to relatives.

I am pretty excited. I wished I went to get my Master's for a while, and went so far as to take the GMAT and attend UCLA MBA meetings with a half-filled out application before I backed off because my life got hectic.

What is cool is that it is an online program that has an in-person component, so I can meet everyone in the flesh and come down to campus and participte still in student life. I really didn't want a fully online program, and I wanted to stay working instead of doing a full time program that would have a heavier opportunity cost.

I am also clearing the calendar for the next two years since there is a decent chance I just kissed my hobbies and free time goodbye.
