The Austin Final Report.

Austin, Texas has a lot going for it. The food was great, the place looks like it was built 15 minutes ago, there is a lot of construction, and the weather for our time here was pretty fantastic. 

In thinking more about what I would like the coming semester to look like, I have some lifestyle choices I need to make also.
