### Description
<http://teamextenda.com>

This site is my first public hand-coded site. While I don't love how it looks now, at the time, it seemed like a good idea, and was pretty performant by jettisoning bulky frameworks and templates. It was mostly an informational site with some downloads for customers.

I had a WordPress blog I connected to but the site itself was standalone PHP.

### Stack
PHP,
HTML,
CSS
jQuery,
JavaScript

### Features
Marketing Site,
Downloadable content,
Integrated Blog

### Style
Clean, modern, streamlined with easy to use roll-down menus for nav since there is a ton of content here. We wanted the 'Extenda Red' to be prominent. There are a few specialized sub-domains that served as landing pages that have distinct styles.

### Repo
This is a privately hosted site using native PHP.
