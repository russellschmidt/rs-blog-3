### Description
<https://dublin-countdown-rs.herokuapp.com/>

My wife and I were meeting some of our favorite friends (who happen to be Icelandic) in Dublin, Ireland. I was so excited I made a countdown page featuring some of the worst cliches of Irish culture and also Colin Farrell for the ladies. Ironically perhaps we did end up seeing Riverdance and stag/hen parties across Dublin where various Leprechaun outfits were worn.

This site is unapologetically terrible but it again shows the fun that can be had with React on a single page app.

### Stack
React 15,
Node,
Heroku,
HTML5,
CSS,
GIFs

### Features
Horrible UI,
Single Page Application,
Heroku,
Too many GIFs

### Style
Abysmal. This is hard on the eyes. I made it as a joke.
