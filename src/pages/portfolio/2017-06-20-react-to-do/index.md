### Description
<https://react-todo-rms.herokuapp.com>

Everyone needs a to do app, especially when we are making a new project in a new language or framework. I think I have 100 of these in some form or other by now. This To Do app is for elite hackers only, since you need a GitHub login. 

You can add and remove to-do items, they persist with your login, and overall, it works as advertised.

### Stack
React,
Node,
Webpack,
UUID,
Foundation,
Firebase,
Karma,
Heroku,
HTML,
CSS

### Features
TDD,
Save items, 
Reactive components,
Responsive design,
3rd party (GitHub) authentication

### Style
Minimalist. As Deiter Rams said, "Less but better" and I followed that to a T here, with simple functional styling and not a drop shadow or rounded corner in sight.
