Today I am taking a break from coding for the first time in what feels like years but is realistically the first time since my honeymoon last summer. I am going to Austin, Texas to see friends and ideally pick up some cowboy boots and a new appreciation for barbecued meats despite my vegan soul's earnest desire to live animal-free.
