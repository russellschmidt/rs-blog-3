### Description
<https://hello-world-of-shit.herokuapp.com>

Caution - I work blue. This is **NSFW**. 

As a kid I loved soundboards. They were super fun to make prank phone calls with and I could hear all my favorite Adam Sandler movie quotes over and over again. I'd of course always wanted to make one, though the fun part of actually getting the sound to play is balanced by the tedium of gathering together the audio and, if its copyrighted, worrying about the legalities. Far more fun to just use a couple of open licensed MP3 files as we have here.
