It appears gentle reader that I am going to be a summer intern at a company called Synacor. Some say it could never be done. Others say, damn you are one old intern.

Synacor has a few product lines. They are the company behind Zimbra, an enterprise email alternative to Exchange and Gmail. Like Styx, they are huge in Japan and Europe.

Another product they have is CloudID, which handles the authentication for applications like HBOGo. 

The product I will be working with is [start.att.net](start.att.net), one of the 40+ telecom company portals the company white labels.  This particular portal has around 3,000,000 daily unique visitors, is the default homepage for the Android phones sold by AT&T Mobility (with 80,000,000 customers), and handles thousands and thousands of pieces of content from publishers that are household names.

This is an interesting challenge for a few reasons. For one, the team for this site alone is bigger than most startups I have worked for.
