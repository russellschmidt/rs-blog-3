### Description
<https://pomodoro-timer-rs.herokuapp.com>

I am fascinated by learning methodologies and productivity tracking so the Pomodoro technique was of interest. There was an opportunity to make one via my apprenticeship at Bloc and I am very happy I took that chance! I actually use this timer all the time.

### Stack
JavaScript,
Angular 1,
Firebase,
HTML5,
CSS,
Heroku,
Grunt

### Features
Pomodoro Timer,
Task Manager,
Productivity

### Style
Pomodoro is Italian for 'tomato' so that influenced the clean style and color choice. I also added helpful bouncy tomato gifs to track the amount of Pomodoro cycles the user has been through - at 4, it is time to take a longer break.
