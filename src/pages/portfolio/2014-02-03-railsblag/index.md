### Description
<https://railsblog-rms.herokuapp.com>

They say if you aren't embarrassed of your first release, you waited too long. I certainly did not wait too long with this rails app that we made in a General Assembly class as a tutorial.

I keep this around because it was one of my first projects, and I had fun making it. The styling is atrocious. It is great to see how far you came and maybe someone can see this and feel inspired.

### Stack
Ruby on Rails,
sqlite,
Faker

### Features
Post Articles,
Post Comments,
The Basics.

### Style
This is what one might call an unstyled app. I prefer to thing of it as utilitarian.
