Well, I did it. I got into the USC Iovine and Young Academy, to get my Master's in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology. The shorthand is Design@USC, which is a lot easier to type but no easier to explain to relatives.

I am pretty excited. I am also clearing the calendar for the next two years since there is a decent chance I just kissed my hobbies and free time goodbye.
